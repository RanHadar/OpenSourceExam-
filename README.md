# OpenSourceExam
This is a part of Open source course exam, I've created an upload file process then converted the file to PDF using OCR.


To Run these files, clone it.
Run the command - "npm install ejs express multer tesseract.js"
then to auto update everything with the server, you can run the command
npm install --save-dev nodemon


Running the projct will be done by writing:
npm start

Enter: http://localhost:5000/
