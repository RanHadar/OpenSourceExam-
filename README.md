# OpenSourceExam
This is a new base line for the project, I've created an upload file process then conversting it to PDF using OCR.


To Run these files, clone it.
Run the command - npm install ejs express multer tesseract.js \n
then to auto update everything with the server, you can run the command
npm install --save-dev nodemon


Running the projct will be done by writing:
npm start

Enter: http://localhost:5000/
